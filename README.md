This monorepo contains the various JavaScript apps and libraries maintained by Homebase. These resources are designed to empower app developers to seamlessly integrate with a Homebase Identity backend, enabling secure, decentralized, and user-centric identity solutions. By leveraging these tools, developers can build powerful applications that prioritize privacy, interoperability, and user control.

## Overview of Packages

### Apps

The following apps are built on the Homebase platform, showcasing its capabilities and providing ready-to-use functionality. Each app depends on **JS-Lib**, **UI-Lib**, and **Common-App** for shared logic and components:

- ðŸš€ **Feed App**: A personalized content feed.
- ðŸš€ **Chat App**: Secure messaging platform.
- ðŸš€ **Mail App**: Decentralized email client.
- ðŸš€ **Community App**: A platform for group collaboration and community building.
- ðŸš€ **Public App**: Public-facing interfaces.
- ðŸš€ **Owner App**: Administrative tools and dashboards.

Each app is designed as a stand-alone platform app and can be independently extracted from the monorepo.

### Libraries

- ðŸ“š **JS-Lib**: Core JavaScript library for interacting with the Homebase Identity backend. Includes essential utilities and logic for building on the platform.
- âœ¨ **UI-Lib**: A reusable UI component library, enabling consistent design and interaction patterns across Homebase-based apps.
- ðŸ›  **Common-App**: A library of shared components and modules used by all platform apps. While tailored for Homebase's branded apps, this package is not designed for use outside of the Homebase ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Installing Libraries

To use the libraries in your project, you can install them directly from GitHub Packages:

- [JS-Lib](https://github.com/homebase-id/odin-js/pkgs/npm/js-lib)
- [UI-Lib](https://github.com/homebase-id/odin-js/pkgs/npm/ui-lib)

You also need to create a GitHub Classic Token in order to read the repos in Homebase, follow this guide:
https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token

#### Prerequisite: DotYouClient

The libraries depend on a **DotYouClient** instance, which manages authentication parameters for API requests. Ensure you configure the `DotYouClient` correctly to interact with your Homebase Identity backend.

### Running the Apps Locally

Before starting the apps, ensure you have the backend server running. You can find it here: [HOMEBASE.ID (ODIN-CORE)](https://github.com/homebase-id/odin-core).

1. **Install dependencies and build libraries**:

```
npm install && npm run build:libs
```

2. **Run the apps**:

- Run all apps concurrently:

```
npm run start
```

- Or run a specific app:

```
npm run start:[feed/chat/mail/community/public/owner]
```

3. **Build the apps**:

```
npm run build
```
